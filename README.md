# TSF_Intern_Tasks
Tasks worked on while working as an intern at TSF.

* Task-2  -->  Supervised Machine Learning using Linear Regression
  * Prediction of the Score of the student for the number of studied based on the given data for the same.
* Task-3  -->  Unsupervised Learning using K-Means Clustering 
  * Using the K-Means Clustering Algorithm for the Iris dataset to identify the different species based on the clusters' predicted (calculated) means form the dataset. 
* Task-4  -->  Decision Tree Classifier to classify the data and label the the categories based on the variable metrics in the data.
  * Using the Decision Tree Classifier to classify the Iris dataset and label the the categories based on the different metrics such as petal length & width, and sepal length & width as given in the data.
* Task-5  -->  SampleSuperStore Sales Data Analysis Using **Power BI**
  * Checkout the Power BI file with the dataset to see the visuals and understand the Sales performance of Sample SuperStore.
